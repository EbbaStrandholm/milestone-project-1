<h2> Design </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Color </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The website consists of two variations of blue, a lighter tone for the background and a darker tone for the
                banners. Inside the banners the text and icons (footer) will be the same color as the background to provide a nice feel, and to give of a feel of an optical illusion. This is consistent throughout the 3 separate pages of the website. Since the colour are all blue, but of different tones/shades it also makes the website easy to read for colorblind users</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Fonts </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The Roboto font (from https://fonts.google.com/) is used throughout the whole website, with Sans-Sariff as a fallback font. Roboto is a clean and easily redable font, in both italic and bold and provides a pleasant read for the user when visiting the website</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Images </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The hero image on the home page is depicts two horses grazing with a mountain in the background. This, as well as the colors and fonts used will create a peaceful and non-stressing environment in order to make the user feel comfortable using the website.</li>

<h2> Testing </h2>
    <p>
        Testing was done on AnkarlooHorse using the https://validator.w3.org/ website and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ website. Throughout the whole project, no known errors or bugs has shown when run through the code validators. I also shared the github pages link with friends and family to have them check the website's responsiveness and overall design and structure.
        <p>
        So far, the overall result has been great with only a few tweaks, such as the footer and menu links placement when viewed on a smaller device, which where pointed out by said family and friends. This was also only possible due the the great feeback and guidance done by my mentor, Dario Carrasquel, who pointed out early in development what needed to be done in order to get a passing grade, as well as keep me on course when I strayed a little too far.
