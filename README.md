<h2> User Experience </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>First User Goals</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a first time user, I want to easily navigate my way through the website, from the home 
                    page to the video exercise page, and to the sign up form</li>
                    <li>As a first time user, I want to easily understand the purpose and its content on the website. I also want to be able to find the social media links related to the website, and for them to work without forcing me to leave the page I am currently on</li>
                    <li>As a first time user, I do not want to be having difficulties reading the content displayed, meaning that the background or the color of the text does not disturb</li>
                </ul>
            <li><h3>Returning User Goals</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a returning user, I want the website to have updated information when the practices change, so it stays up to date as not to confuse the user.</li>
                    <li>As a returning user, I want the webbsite to stay the same in turns of style and accessability, so as not to confuse the users navigation upon return</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

<h2> Design </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Color </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The website consists of two variations of blue, a lighter tone for the background and a darker tone for the
                banners. Inside the banners the text and icons (footer) will be the same color as the background to provide a nice feel, and to give of a feel of an optical illusion of the  banner being hollow. This is consistent throughout the 3 separate pages of the website except the form, which does not have any banners or a footer. Since the colors are all blue, but of different tones/shades it also makes the website easy to read for colorblind users. This is shown in the images below</li>
            </ul>

![Design of website: footer](/assets/screenshots/cimp1-index3.png "Footer and banner design")
        <li> Fonts </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The Roboto font (from https://fonts.google.com/) is used throughout the whole website, with Sans-Sariff as a fallback font. Roboto is a clean and easily readable font, in both italic and bold and provides a pleasant read for the user when visiting the website</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Images </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The hero image on the home page is depicts two horses grazing with a mountain in the background. This, as well as the colors and fonts used will create a peaceful and non-stressing environment in order to make the user feel comfortable using the website. The other images used below the hero image are used as complementary images to the relevent text besides them, and as an example, so to say, of what some of the equestrian practices look like.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>

<h2> Features </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Responsive design has been created for all devices which are shown in the images below. However, as the readme.md would become to lenghty for anyone to read with images showing all the pages scrolled all the way through, I added only exemplary images to the readme.md showing that they are responsive. All of the necessary images, however, have been added to the screenshot folder in assets for anyone interested in inspekting </li>

<h2> Testing </h2>
    <p>
        Testing was done on AnkarlooHorse using the https://validator.w3.org/ website and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ website. Throughout the whole project, no known errors or bugs has shown when run through the code validators. I also shared the github pages link with friends and family to have them check the website's responsiveness and overall design and structure.
        <p>
        So far, the overall result has been great with only a few tweaks, such as the footer and menu links placement when viewed on a smaller device, which where pointed out by said family and friends. This was also only possible due the the great feeback and guidance done by my mentor, Dario Carrasquel, who pointed out early in development what needed to be done in order to get a passing grade, as well as keep me on course when I strayed a little too far.
