<h2> Design </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Color </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The website consists of two variations of blue, a lighter tone for the background and a darker tone for the
                banners. Inside the banners the text and icons (footer) will be the same color as the background to provide a nice feel, and to give of a feel of an optical illusion. This is consistent throughout the 3 separate pages of the website. Since the colour are all blue, but of different tones/shades it also makes the website easy to read for colorblind users</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Fonts </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The Roboto font (from https://fonts.google.com/) is used throughout the whole website, with Sans-Sariff as a fallback font. Roboto is a clean and easily redable font, in both italic and bold and provides a pleasant read for the user when visiting the website</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Images </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The hero image on the home page is depicts two horses grazing with a mountain in the background. This, as well as the colors and fonts used will create a peacful and non-stressing environment in order to make the user feel comfortable using the website.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
